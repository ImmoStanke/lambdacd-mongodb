# lambdacd-mongodb

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/lambdacd-mongodb/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/lambdacd-mongodb)

If you use [LambdaCD](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd) in an environment without persistence you certainly noticed that after restarting LambdaCD the build history is lost. lambdacd-mongodb stores the state of your pipeline in a MongoDB and it restores it at the next startup.

## Nice to know

* Only builds with the same defintion can be restored (-> [LambdaCD Issue #6](https://github.com/flosell/lambdacd/issues/6))
* Every running or waiting build is displayed as killed after restoring
* Only builds with at least two active steps are stored because you don't need builds waiting for a trigger 
* Tested with LambdaCD version 0.5.3

## Example

1. Start your local MongoDB daemon (default port: 27017)
2. Run `lein run`
3. Let the pipeline run for a few times
4. Stop LambdaCD by pressing strg-c in your terminal
5. Restart LambdaCD bei running `lein run` again
6. The build history should still be there

## Configuration

1. To use lambdacd-mongodb you have to create a map containing your MongoDB configuration.
   * The :col key specifies the collection which is used to store all builds from one pipeline. Do not use a collection for more than one pipeline!
   * The :max-builds key is optional (default: 20) and definies how many inactive builds are loaded. Active builds are thrown away because you can not continue them.
   * The :ttl key is optional (default: 7) and definies how many days the builds should be stored
2. Add the mongodb configuration map to the main configuration by using the key name :mongodb-cfg

```clojure
(defn -main [& args]
  (let [home-dir (util/create-temp-dir)
        mongodb-cfg {:uri          "mongodb://localhost:27017/lambdacd"
                     :db           "lambdacd"
                     :col          "test-project"
                     :max-builds   10
                     :ttl          7
                     :pipeline-def pipeline-def}
        config {:mongodb-cfg              mongodb-cfg
                :home-dir                 home-dir
                :dont-wait-for-completion false}
        pipeline (lambdacd.core/assemble-pipeline pipeline-def config (mongodb-state/new-mongodb-state config))
        [...]
```
